# Customer-Shopping-Behaviour-Analysis
I recently completed a detailed Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis project using Python and Pandas, where I explored a dataset of 3,900+ customer records to understand purchasing trends, preferences, and spending patterns.  I’m excited to continue building more projects like this and would love your feedback or suggestions!
